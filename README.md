# Hi, I'm Aishani!

I'm a student interested in software engineering and data science! I've gained a lot of full-stack development experience through my activities and am coding up side projects to gain experience in new fields. Currently, I'm working on a more data-focused project to grow my skillset!

## Projects
- Chess: A client-server chess game built in Python with the socket and threading modules. This project leverages pygame for the GUI and enables concurrent gameplay on the server. 
- Check-In: An automated check-in service for Southwest Airlines that also downloads a PDF boarding pass. Built with Python, Selenium, and the subprocess module, this tool is run from the terminal and streamlines browser interactions for better seats.
