# Hi, I'm Aishani!

I'm a full-stack developer specializing in JavaScript (Node.js/React.js), Flask, SQL, and Python.

Currently, I'm working full-time as a software engineering intern and started these projects to gain more experience in my free time. 
Having a strong background in web development and app development, I'm now focusing on back-end projects in Python to expand my expertise.

Feel free to explore my repositories or check back in and see my progress!!

## Projects
- Chess: A client-server chess game built in Python with the socket and threading modules. This project leverages pygame for the GUI and enables concurrent gameplay on the server. 
- Check-In: An automated check-in service for Southwest Airlines that also downloads a PDF boarding pass. Built with Python, Selenium, and the subprocess module, this tool is run from the terminal and streamlines browser interactions for better seats.
